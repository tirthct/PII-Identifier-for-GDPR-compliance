Yiddish with the Workmen's Circle. l have met
several people from my online class in person.
Yiddish is much more than a language, it is a
cultural thread uniting people into one big
family. l have gone from almost a beginner to
an advanced student. I feel it is almost
impossible to stop once you have started."
